      <description>Python is a programming language like R. Codes that are done in R can also be similarity done in Python as well. A few examples can be taken from Homework 1 and Homework 10. The dataset, &amp;quot;quakes&amp;quot; is about the locations of Earthquakes off Fiji since 1964. The numeric variables recorded includes the latitude, longtitude, depth, magnitude, and stations of the events. The two main packages I will be showing in Python are Pandas and NumPy.</description>
